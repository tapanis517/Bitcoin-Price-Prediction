# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction
Used historical data on the price of Bitcoin, along with data from Wikipedia about edits to the Bitcoin page.  Merged and combined this data, then used it to train a random forest model that will tell us if Bitcoin prices will increase or decrease tomorrow. Then switch to an XGBoost model and better predictors to improve accuracy.
